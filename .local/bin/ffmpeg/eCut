Usage: eCut DURATION VIDEO OUTPUT
Make a clip that is DURATION from the end of VIDEO.

DURATION must be a negative number.

See ffmpeg-utils manual page for valid time duration formats for DURATION.

ffmpeg will encode the video which will significantly increase
the time on making the clip compared to copying the streams (-c copy).

  -h, --help                Shows this help text and exits.

Examples:
Make a clip that
is the last 15 seconds of a video:
eCut -15 input.mp4 output.mp4

Last 5 minutes:
eCut -05:00 input.mp4 output.mp4
END
}

# -sseof makes ffmpeg write DURATION (e.g., 15 seconds) from
# the end of video be the output.
